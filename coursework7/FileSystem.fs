module FileSystem

(*
   This module provides a type FsTree. We often refer to elements of
   this type as filesystems. But FsTree is just a datatype of certain
   trees.

   In particular, there is no difference between files and directories
   in this representation. We often refer to a node in the tree as a
   directory.

   This module also provides incomplete definitions of certain
   functions operating on filesystems. Note that you have to define
   the required FsCheck properties against these functions.
